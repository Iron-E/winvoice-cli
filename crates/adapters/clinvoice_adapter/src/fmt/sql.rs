//! Contains constants for various SQL keywords. Useful to prevent any possibility of misspelling
//! a keyword, or forgetting to insert spaces around keywords.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Ideally, a misspelling like in `misspelling_compiles` would result in a compile-time errorâ€” any
//! SQL includes the output from `misspelling_compiles` would be invalid as well.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use pretty_assertions::assert_eq;
//! fn misspelling_compiles(columns: &str, table: &str) -> String {
//!   format!("SELCT {columns} FROM{table}")
//! }
//! # assert_eq!(&misspelling_compiles("a, b, c, d", "foo"), "SELCT a, b, c, d FROMfoo");
//! ```
//!
//! ```rust,compile_fail
//! use clinvoice_adapter::fmt::sql::{SELECT, FROM};
//! fn misspelling_compiles_not(columns: &str, table: &str) -> String {
//!   format!("{SELCT}{columns}{FROM}{table}")
//! }
//! ```
